There are so many destinations that are not as well known to people outside China as Beijing or Yangshuo. Why did I mention Yangshuo? Because I knew someone who went there just for climbing, and I think it should be a popular destination for people outside of China. Also, the people of Yangshuo have already hosted so many foreigners when I was there almost 20 years ago.

I don't know if that's just my bias, because I saw a few foreigners when I was in Luoyang. And Henan province is famous for the Shaolin Temple.

**Why Luoyang**

To be honest, I am writing this in the hope that more Chinese people will get to know the rich history of this city, which was the capital of 13 different dynasties. While we pay a lot of attention to the beautiful nature, we should not forget the beauty of historical places and cultures. Luoyang is one of those cities, it may not have the most amazing nature, but the ancient ruins and museums are another kind of amazing.

**Where is Luoyang?**

I think a lot of people have heard of the Shaolin Temple and I saw a lot of visitors when I was there last week. Luoyang is a city near Songshan Mountain, about 1.5 hours by car. Actually, the Shaolin Temple is closer to Luoyang than to Zhengzhou, the capital of Hunan Province. Luoyang is easily accessible by high-speed train from major cities, taking about 6 hours from Guangzhou/Shanghai and only 3 hours from Beijing.

**Things to do in Luoyang**

I'm not going to write details about each place, because you can easily find that information on Wiki. I will give tips based on my first hand experience.

A must see place in Luoyang, the downside is tooooo many people. Longmen Hill (aka West Hill) is the main place with statues and you have to enter from the north entrance and exit from the south entrance. You cannot enter from the south. In summer there is a light show after sunset, but it is a separate ticket and you have to book the night ticket.

Nigh ticket: entry time 17:31-19:30, ticket office closes at 19:30. 

Some say you can stay inside with the day ticket and enjoy the night show, but I would recommend getting there at 17:30 so you can enjoy the day and night views at the same time. It takes a lot of energy to stay long if you get there too early. I went at around 15:30 and was exhausted before sunset and was on the east side of the river, I literally had no energy to walk back to the West entrance. 

Important note: except for the Xiangshan Temple, all the other sites close after 18:00. So you need to plan your trip very carefully. There are far fewer tourists at the East Hill Caves, but there are also fewer statues there. However, from the east side of the river you can get a good view of Longmen Hill.

**Tips for transports**

You can ask the hostel staff and various taxi/uber drivers to get the actual price range for going somewhere a bit further away such as Longtan valley, Shaolin Temple and Laojun Mountain. In China there is no Uber but Didi or Gaode/Baidu Maps, but I would use 'Uber' for the internet based ride-hailing services in my article just to make it easier to understand. It is quite easy even if you use Uber for a one-way trip and call another one for the return trip, but my experience is the cost could be quite similar, no more than 5 EUR difference. So I recommended it for a return trip so you are more relaxed. Unless you plan to stay overnight, then a one-way Uber is more suitable.

**Shaolin Temple**

Cost: 300-400 RMB / car (four seats) for a round trip.

I was there when the 2024 Global Shaolin Games Finals conclued, on 14 July 2024. I was climbing up to the Bodhidharma Pavilion (chu'zu'an) and the Bodhidharma Cave (da'mo'dong) when the competition happened, and it had almost finished while I in front of the Shaolin Temple after visiting the Bodhidharma Cave. The cave is not a popular site within the area, even the drivers for minibus did not suggest this destination. He only recommended us to go to the xxx and the temple. Somehow the Chinese are more and more anxious and just visit a place to declare that they have been there once.
