There are so many destinations that are not as well known to people outside China as Beijing or Yangshuo. Why did I mention Yangshuo? Because I knew someone who went there just for climbing, and I think it should be a popular destination for people outside of China. Also, the people of Yangshuo have already hosted so many foreigners when I was there almost 20 years ago.

I don't know if that's just my bias, because I saw a few foreigners when I was in Luoyang. And Henan province is famous for the Shaolin Temple.

**Tips for transports**

You can ask the hostel staff and various taxi/uber drivers to get the actual price range for going somewhere a bit further away. In China there is no Uber but Didi or Gaode/Baidu Maps, but I would use 'Uber' for the internet based ride-hailing services in my article just to make it easier to understand. It is quite easy even if you use Uber for a one-way trip and call another way for the return, but my experience is the cost could be quite similar, no more than 5 EUR difference. So I recommended it for a return trip so you are more relaxed. Unless you plan to stay overnight, then a one-way Uber is more suitable.

**Where is Luoyang?**

I think a lot of people have heard of the Shaolin Temple and I saw a lot of visitors when I was there last week. Luoyang is a city near Songshan Mountain, about 1.5 hours by car. Actually, the Shaolin Temple is closer to Luoyang than to Zhengzhou, the capital of Hunan Province. Luoyang is easily accessible by high-speed train from major cities, taking about 6 hours from Guangzhou/Shanghai and only 3 hours from Beijing.

**Things to do in Luoyang**

1. [Longmen Grottoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longmen_Grottoes) 

2. Luoyang Museum


**Shaolin Temple**

Cost: 300-400 RMB / car (four seats) for a round trip.

I was there when the 2024 Global Shaolin Games Finals conclued, on 14 July 2024. I was climbing up to the Bodhidharma Pavilion (chu'zu'an) and the Bodhidharma Cave (da'mo'dong) when the competition happened, and it had almost finished while I in front of the Shaolin Temple after visiting the Bodhidharma Cave. The cave is not a popular site within the area, even the drivers for minibus did not suggest this destination. He only recommended us to go to the xxx and the temple. Somehow the Chinese are more and more anxious and just visit a place to declare that they have been there once.
