There are so many destinations that are not as well known to people outside China as Beijing or Yangshuo. Why did I mention Yangshuo? Because I knew someone who went there just for climbing, I think it should be a popular destination for people outside of China. Also, the people of Yangshuo have already hosted so many foreigners when I was there almost 20 years ago.

**A general note: DO NOT visit popular sites during the National Golden Week (usually 1 Oct to 7 Oct).**

### Why Luoyang?

To be honest, I am writing this in the hope that more Chinese people will get to know the rich history of this city, which was the capital of 13 different dynasties. While we pay a lot of attention to the beautiful nature, we should not forget the beauty of historical places and cultures. Luoyang is one of those cities, it may not have the most amazing nature, but the ancient ruins and museums are another kind of amazing.

### Where is Luoyang?

I think a lot of people have heard of the Shaolin Temple. Luoyang is a city near the Shaolin Temple, about 1.5 hours by car. Actually, the Shaolin Temple is closer to Luoyang than to Zhengzhou, the capital of Hunan Province. Luoyang is easily accessible by high-speed train from major cities, taking about 6 hours from Guangzhou/Shanghai and only 3 hours from Beijing.

### Tips for transports

In China there is no Uber but Didi or Gaode/Baidu Maps, but I would use 'Uber' for the internet based ride-hailing services in my article just to make it easier to understand.

You can get around the city with Uber with 10-15 Yuan (RMB) per trip, the longest ride was from the old town to Longmen Grottoes which could be around 30 Yuan. Of course there are public transports such as metro and bus, it is cheap but takes longer.

You can ask the hostel staff and various taxi/uber drivers to get the actual price range for going somewhere a bit further away such as Longtan valley, Shaolin Temple and Laojun Mountain. It is quite easy even if you use Uber for a one-way trip and call another one for the return trip, but my experience is the cost could be quite similar, no more than 50 Yuan difference. So I recommended to book it for a return trip so you are more relaxed. Unless you plan to stay overnight, then a one-way Uber is more suitable.

### Things to do in Luoyang

I'm not going to write details about each place, because you can easily find that information on Wiki. I will give tips based on my first hand experience.

#### [Longmen Grottoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longmen_Grottoes) 

_Admission: 90 RMB for adult. Free for < 13 and >= 60 years (with valid ID), children <140cm and annual pass holders (annual pass holders cannot enter after 6:00pm)._

A must see place in Luoyang, the downside is tooooo many people. Longmen Hill (aka West Hill) is the main place with statues and you have to enter from the north entrance and exit from the south entrance. You cannot enter from the south. In summer there is a light show after sunset, but it is a separate ticket. 

The tickets are booked for three time slots: enter at 08:00-12:30/12:31-17:30/17:31-19:30. The ticket office closes at 19:30. 

Some say you can stay inside with the day ticket and enjoy the night show, but I have not confirmed this by myself. It takes a lot of energy to stay long if you get there too early. I went at around 15:30 and was exhausted before sunset and was on the east side of the river, I literally had no energy to walk back to the West entrance. I would recommend getting there at 17:30 so you can enjoy the day and night views at the same time. However, if you are well prepared, you could start at around 15:00 and go to the East Hill Caves first and then walk north to the Xiangshan Temple, then cross the river and reach the entrance of Longmen Hill before 17:30. Then you could go in and wait for the lights to come on.

Important note: except for the Xiangshan Temple, all the other sites close after 18:00. So you need to plan your trip very carefully. There are far fewer tourists at the East Hill Caves, but there are also fewer statues there. However, from the east side of the river you can get a good view of Longmen Hill.

#### [Luoyang Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luoyang_Museum)

_Admission is free, but reservations are required. You need to book 3 days in advance to get a place (the reservation system opens at 7:00am). An alternative way to reserve is to book a ticket for the Luoyang Zhouwangcheng Emperor Six Horses Carriage Museum (30 RMB), then a reservation to Luoyang Museum can be made while visiting this museum._

It has collections from the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties and the main exhibits are from the Han and Tang dynasties. It is the place where you could learn about the history back to 21centry BC.

There is a precious piece of the Buddha statue (only a partial face) and people think that the smile is very calming and represents the peaceful mind of Buddhism.

#### [White Horse Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Horse_Temple)

_Admission: 35 RMB for adult. Free for < 13 and >= 60 years (reservation required if not a Chinese citizen), children <140cm and annual ticket holders._

It is the first Buddhist temple in China, built in the Eastern Han Dynasty. There are Indian, Thai and Myanmar style temples surrounding the main building. 

There is a Budda Stupa (also known as Qiyun Pagoda), which was the first stupa in China.

#### Sui and Tang National Heritage Park

_Admission: 90 RMB for adult. Free for < 13 and >= 60 years (with valid ID), children <140cm and annual pass holders._

The Sui and Tang Luoyang City Tiantang Relic Site and the Sui and Tang Luoyang City Mingtang Relic Site were built on the actual ruins in 2009. The rebuilt Tiantang and Mingtang are 33.52 and 88.88 metres high respectively, much shorter than the original 91.43 and 312.09 metres (the original height was an assumption based on historical records).

#### Mount Laojun

![img](/img/in-post/post-luoyang/laojun.jpg){:width="300"}

Make sure you search the one in Henan, apparently there is another Mount Laojun in Yunnan but I've never heard about it.

> Along with the Jiguan Cave, the mountain forms part of a tourist scenic area that is rated as AAAAA, the highest category in the tourist rating system. Historically, the mountain was a retreat for Laozi, the founder of Taoism. (from Wikipedia)

The accommodation is pretty expensive on the top, an economic option would be the youth hostel which costs 150 Yuan per bed.


#### [Longtan Grand Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtan_Grand_Canyon)

_Admission: 80 RMB for adult. Free for < 13 and >= 60 years (with valid ID), children <140cm and annual pass holders._

![img](/img/in-post/post-luoyang/longtan.jpg){:width="300"}

Transport: 300-400 RMB / car (four passengers) for a round trip.

It is a 2h drive from Luoyang. It was a rainning day when I visited there, it has different touch in the rain. We took the minibus (70 RMB including the boat trip) to the end of the valley and walked our way out to the entry. Unfortunetly all the signs are meant to be read for people who walked their way into the valley, so they had no use if you went the other direction.

#### [Hangu Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangu_Pass)

_Admission: 40 RMB for adult. Free for < 13 and >= 60 years, children <140cm and annual ticket holders._

Historically, there are three Hangu Passes, this one was the Han Hangu Pass. Qin Hangu Pass and Wei Hangu Pass are also located in Henan Province. The geographical changes caused by the Yellow River made it necessary to move the pass to another location.

This place is on the way to Longtan Grand Canyon, so you could plan and visit them together on the same day. I think this place has been forgotten because it was really quiet and I only saw a few tourists. In 2014, this archaeological site was recognised by UNESCO as part of the "Silk Roads: the Routes Network of the Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor" World Heritage Site. The Pass was rebuilt in 1923 by Mr Fang Zhang. The recent excavation discovered several roads, platforms and walls around it.

The Qin Hangu Pass attracts more tourists because of Laozi (author of the Tao Te Ching), who is said to have written the Tao Te Ching here before travelling west. The local government rebuilt this place in 1992.

#### [Shaolin Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Monastery)

_Admission: 80 RMB for adult. Free for < 13 and >= 60 years (with valid ID), children <140cm and annual pass holders._

![img](/img/in-post/post-luoyang/shaolin.jpg){:width="300"}

Transport: 300-400 RMB / car (four passengers) for a round trip.

I was there when the 2024 Global Shaolin Games Finals ended on 14 July 2024. I was climbing up to the Bodhidharma Pavilion (chu'zu'an) and the Bodhidharma Cave (da'mo'dong) when the competition took place, and it was almost over by the time I got back to Shaolin Temple. The cave is not a popular place in the area, even the driver of the minibus did not suggest it as a destination. He only recommended that we go to Sanhuang Village, the Pagoda Forest and the Temple. Somehow the Chinese are getting more and more anxious to visit a place just to say they have been there once.

The Pagoda Forest has 240 funerary pagodas of various sizes from the Tang, Song, Jin, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties.

The best view is actually from Sanhuangzhai Scenic Spot (aka Sanhuang Village), it takes 10 minutes if you take the cable car (70 RMB) from the station nearby the Pagoda Forest. But there would be another 4 hours hike if you want to see more, I couldn't do it because we didn't have enough time and the walk is too much for younger children. I think a better route would be to take a taxi from the North Shaolin Temple Tourist Centre to the South Sanhuangzhai Tourist Centre, then change to a minibus (20 RMB) to the starting point of the walk. You would see the Songshan Buddhist Academy and the amazing mountain views. I don't have much to say, see with your eyes ^_^
