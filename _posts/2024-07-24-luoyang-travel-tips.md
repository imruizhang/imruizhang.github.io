There are some many destinations that are not as famous as Beijing or Yangshuo for the foreigners. Why did I mention Yangshuo? Because I knew someone who went there just for climbing, I figure it should be a popular destination for people outside China. Plus people in Yangshuo already hosted so many foreigners while I visited there almost 20 years ago.

**Where is Luoyang?**

I think a lot of people heard about Shaolin Temple and I also saw quite a lot of foreingers last week when I was there. Luoyang is a city near Songshan Mountain, about 1.5h by car. It is closer to Luoyang than Zhengzhou, the capical city of Hunan Province.
