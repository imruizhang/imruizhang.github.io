Hey, I am Jessie from China. I like to travel, discover delicious local food and nice destinations that are less popular.

I am working my way to becoming a digital nomad, after reading the book The Almanack of Naval Ravikant, I found my passion lies in searching for information and I am good at finding things (whatever it is).
